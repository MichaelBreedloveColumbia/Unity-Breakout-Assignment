# Overview

It's basically the same as the Monogame version, just slightly more polished. I added some fancy trails to the ball and paddle and some basic custom sprites.
Just like the old version, the ball gets faster when it hits the paddle, and slower when it breaks a brick. I also borrowed an idea from a classmate and added a point multiplier which increases upon breaking a brick, and resets when it hits the paddle.
